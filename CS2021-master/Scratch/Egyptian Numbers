The Egyptians could easily handle simple fractions, but with one
remarkable peculiarity. The only fractions they used were 2/3 and the
reciprocals of the integers, the so-called unit fractions with unit
numerators.

Curious though this treatment of fractions may seem to us, no doubt it
seemed both natural and easy to them.Thus their answer to the problem, 
'divide seven loaves among ten men' was not 7/10 of a loaf each, 
but the fraction 1/2 + 1/5.

Can all proper fractions be expressed as the sum of unit fractions,
without repetition? Yes, as Fibonacci showed in his Liber Abaci,
where he described what is now called the greedy algorithm. The greedy 
algorithm is to subtract the largest possible unit fraction, then do the same again, and so on.

Sylvester proved in 1880 that applying this greedy algorithm to the
fraction p/q, where p is less than q, produces a sequence of no more
than p unit fractions.

Write a python program from scratch which reads two integers p and q from the command line
and outputs a sum of no more than p unit fractions equal to p/q.
